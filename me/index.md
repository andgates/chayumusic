I have been drinking tea for as long as I can remember. Growing up in a Russian household, there was always raspberry tea for a sore throat, ginger tea for an upset stomach, and strong black tea with breakfast. The culture behind tea ceremonies, the resulting tranquility, internal serenity, ever growing appreciation for minute taste varieties, and connection with nature, has always had a special place in my heart. It is these elements of the tea culture that I try to implement into my daily life, including my music. I intend to share the patience, awareness, and acceptance that I learn with those that I come in contact, whether physically or sonically. Apart from tea, I find my influences in other things that bring be a feeling of contentment. I love being surrounded by snow capped mountains, rolling ocean waves, and getting lost in star speckled skies. I have also found that a physical need to move and use my body sheds light on my mental and creative state. My body finds peace in skiing, surfing, and yoga practice.
